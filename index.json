In my Ph.D., I am researching mechanisms to improve RISC-V Dynamic Binary Translation to x86, ARM, and MIPS, having in mind IoT/FOG environments. During the last years, I also had experience working for the industry doing an internship at MATERA Systems (2010) and Samsung Brasil (2017), in both working with compilers, JIT compilers and static analysis. Recently, I also had the opportunity to do part of my doctorate as invited research at INESC-ID in Lisbon/Portugal working with deep learning deployment, optimization, and hardware co-design.\nI have a wide range of programming and software engineering skills with a long term experience working with modern C++, C, Python, and GNU/Linux systems.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"/author/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/admin/","section":"author","summary":"I am an experienced Compiler, JIT compiler, Dynamic Binary Translator, and Deep Learning deployment and hardware co-design researcher, with a bachelor in Computer Science (UEM, 2016) and on the way to finish a doctorate in Computer Science in one of the most prestigious universities from Latin America, Unicamp, SP/Brazil.
