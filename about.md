I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UNICAMP in Brazil and work as a Deep Learning Compiler Engineer at Cadence Design Systems in San Jose, US. My experience includes working with programming languages such as Python, C, C++, ONNX, MLIR, and Linux Shell, and contributing to FLOSS projects like LLVM, TensorFlow/XLA, and QEMU.

I am a Brazilian, I enjoy traveling and engaging in activities like inline skating and dancing (forro, salsa, and samba). I am also passionate about learning, particularly in areas like physics, math, and computer science. Through this blog, I hope to share some of the things that I am learning in my personal and professional life.
